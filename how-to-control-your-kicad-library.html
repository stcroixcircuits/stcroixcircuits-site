    <h1>How to Control Your KiCad Library</h1>
    <p>
        Many engineering teams use KiCad for PCB design but struggle to maintain a clean, consistent, and reliable component library.<
        <br><img src = "assets/img/Gemini_Generated_Image_vtupe5vtupe5vtup.png" alt="Engineers frustrated over symbols and footprints" width = "300">
        <br>Symbols and footprints often drift over time, parameters become inconsistent, and duplicated parts accumulate across multiple projects.
        <br>This page explains the common problems, the characteristics of a well-controlled KiCad library, and how St. Croix Circuits provides a structured solution.
    </p>

    <h2>Why KiCad Library Control Matters</h2>
    <p>
        A well-managed library is essential for reliable design work. <br>Uncontrolled libraries lead to errors during schematic capture,
        mismatched footprints during layout, and unpredictable manufacturing results. <br>Teams often lose time rebuilding components,
        tracking down inconsistencies, or debugging preventable issues caused by outdated or incorrect library parts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Good library management improves design quality, reduces risk, and increases engineering efficiency.
    </p>

    <h2>Common KiCad Library Problems</h2>

    <h3>Symbols and Footprints Don’t Match</h3>
    <p>
        Engineers often discover mismatches between schematic symbols and PCB footprints late in the design process,
        leading to rework or layout delays.
    </p>

    <h3>Decentralized or Hidden Libraries</h3>
    <p>
        When libraries exist in multiple folders or inside project directories, no single “source of truth” exists,
        causing teams to reuse outdated components.
    </p>

    <h3>Missing or Inconsistent Parameters</h3>
    <p>
        Fields such as manufacturer part number, datasheet link, value, tolerance, and supplier information
        frequently vary between components.
    </p>

    <h3>No Naming Conventions</h3>
    <p>
        Inconsistent naming makes it difficult to search, reuse, and maintain components, especially across
        multiple engineers or projects.
    </p>

    <h3>Duplicate or Legacy Components</h3>
    <p>
        Over time, old or duplicated parts accumulate, leading to confusion and accidental use of outdated versions.
    </p>

    <h3>Lack of Version Control</h3>
    <p>
        Many teams do not track library changes, making it difficult to revert, audit, or verify component modifications.
    </p>

    <h2>What a Controlled KiCad Library Looks Like</h2>
    <p>A well-structured KiCad library has the following characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>one authoritative source of components</li>
        <li>consistent naming and folder structure</li>
        <li>unified symbol and footprint conventions</li>
        <li>standardized parameters</li>
        <li>footprints aligned to IPC guidelines</li>
        <li>version control integration</li>
        <li>documented rules for future additions</li>
        <li>predictable behavior during schematic and layout</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This structure improves reliability and enables multiple engineers to work confidently with shared components.
    </p>
