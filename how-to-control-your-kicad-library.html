    <h1>How to Control Your KiCad Library</h1>
    <p><span>
        Many engineering teams use KiCad for PCB design but struggle to maintain a clean, consistent, and reliable component library.
        <br>Symbols and footprints often drift over time, parameters become inconsistent, and duplicated parts accumulate across multiple projects.
        <br>This page explains the common problems, the characteristics of a well-controlled KiCad library, and how St. Croix Circuits provides a structured solution.

    <h2>Why KiCad Library Control Matters</h2>
    <p><img src ="assets/img/error.png" class="left">
        <span>
        A well-managed library is essential for reliable design work. <br>Uncontrolled libraries lead to errors during schematic capture,
        mismatched footprints during layout, and unpredictable manufacturing results. <br>Teams often lose time rebuilding components,
        tracking down inconsistencies, or debugging preventable issues caused by outdated or incorrect library parts.
        </span> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Good library management improves design quality, reduces risk, and increases engineering efficiency.
